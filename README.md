# roblox-executor
ðŸ‘ŠIts a basic roblox lua executor made with net framework and WeAreDevs_API


just open the directory bin/debug and execute the .exe , its opensource so if the av detects like a virus its probably the WeAreDevs_API, check it by urself and go enjoy in rolox ðŸ‘Š


## Actually my firs C# app :3
